## FAQ

### Is the design history for the models available? If not, why not?

While there exists partial design history for some model parts, the geometry moved through different software packages. Additionally, in many of the places where it exists, it has become so convoluted that it is (almost) unusable. If you requite the design history, it probably makes more sense to recreate the particular parts from scratch.

## Car Models

(The actually interesting section.)

### FirstCar

As the name suggests, this car was the first one. It even existed before any other part of the game was written as an exploration of whether we would be able to create 3D assets. Additionally, it was the only car for the longest time with the other car options being added rather late.

This car symbolizes a normal 4 to 5 person car. Please drive careful as to not endanger you or your fellow passengers.

### Transporter

The previous car transported persons, this car enabled you to move your stuff between places. It is _suggested_ to avoid flips with the hope of your goods arriving in the same condition as they were in on departure. But of course, your car, your rules. Still, please secure your load properly.

### Forklift

Have you already forked something today? Maybe flipped over your opponents? Due to health-safety regulations and a limited view forwards, this car is only allowed to drive _very slowly_. It is mandatory to _not ignore_ this restriction.

### CitiCar - _the cheese wedge_

'We want a chess car'. - chess, chess, cheess, chees, cheese - a _cheese_ car??? - Ok, here you go.

Taking strong inspiration from the iconic (Sebring-Vanguard) Citicar [(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citicar), we proudly present you our interpretation. Probably just as slow as the original from 1970/1980, but considerably newer and instead of an electric motor it uses a magic motor that doesn't even seem to require any power. If you ever happen to meet one in real-life, please give it a hug and kindly greet it from its virtual sibling.
