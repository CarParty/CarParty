# CarParty Repository

CarParty consists of these three programs:
- The Godot Game (branch `main`).
    To start the Godot game, install Godot (last tested: 3.4.2-stable) and open it as a Godot project. 
    Alternatively, go into the folder and type `godot start`.
- The Phone Client (branches `phoneclient` and `phoneclient-stable`).
    To start the phoneclient, consult the README in the `CarPartyClient` folder in that branch.
- The Relay (branch `websocket-relay`)
    To start the relay, consult its readme.
