# CarParty Repository

Runnable downloads of the game can be found on [car-party.de](https://car-party.de).

CarParty consists of these three programs:

## The Godot Game (branch `main`, [(here)](https://github.com/CarParty/CarParty/tree/main))

The main game! Exciting, isn't it?

To start the Godot game, install Godot (last tested: 3.4.2-stable) and open it as a Godot project.

Alternatively, go into the folder and type `godot start`.

## The Phone Client (branches `phoneclient`, [(jump)](https://github.com/CarParty/CarParty/tree/phoneclient) and `phoneclient-stable`, [(jump)](https://github.com/CarParty/CarParty/tree/phoneclient-stable))

The _small_ html web thing on your phone.

To start the phoneclient, consult the README in that branch.

`phoneclient-stable` is automatically deployed to [car-party.de](https://car-party.de) while the version from `phoneclient` is available at [staging.car-party.de](https://staging.car-party.de).

## The Relay (branch `websocket-relay`, [(jump)](https://github.com/CarParty/CarParty/tree/websocket-relay))

Makes the messages go fast (between godot and phoneclient(s)). Also a professional (NAT) puncher.

To start the relay, consult its README.

## Car Models (branch `models`, [(jump)](https://github.com/CarParty/CarParty/tree/models))

Archive for the files related to the misshaped driving blobs.
